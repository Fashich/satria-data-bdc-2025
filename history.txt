Chocolatey v2.5.0
Chocolatey detected you are not running from an elevated command shell
 (cmd/powershell).

 You may experience errors - many functions/packages
 require admin rights. Only advanced users should run choco w/out an
 elevated shell. When you open the command shell, you should ensure
 that you do so with "Run as Administrator" selected. If you are
 attempting to use Chocolatey in a non-administrator setting, you
 must select a different location other than the default install
 location. See
 https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup#non-administrative-install
 for details.

For the question below, you have 20 seconds to make a selection.

 Do you want to continue?([Y]es/[N]o): Y

Chocolatey v2.5.0
Chocolatey detected you are not running from an elevated command shell
 (cmd/powershell).

 You may experience errors - many functions/packages
 require admin rights. Only advanced users should run choco w/out an
 elevated shell. When you open the command shell, you should ensure
 that you do so with "Run as Administrator" selected. If you are
 attempting to use Chocolatey in a non-administrator setting, you
 must select a different location other than the default install
 location. See
 https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup#non-administrative-install
 for details.

For the question below, you have 20 seconds to make a selection.

INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of opencv-python to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 2), -r requirements.txt (line 4) and numpy==1.26.4 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy==1.26.4
    pandas 2.2.2 depends on numpy>=1.26.0; python_version >= "3.12"
    opencv-python 4.12.0.88 depends on numpy<2.3.0 and >=2; python_version >= "3.9"

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

[2/5] Menginstal Python 3.11...
Chocolatey v2.5.0
Uninstalling the following packages:
python
python is not installed. Cannot uninstall a non-existent package.

Chocolatey uninstalled 0/1 packages. 1 packages failed.
 See the log for details (C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log).

Failures
 - python - python is not installed. Cannot uninstall a non-existent package.

If a package uninstall is failing and/or you've already uninstalled the
 software outside of Chocolatey, you can attempt to run the command
 with `-n` to skip running a chocolateyUninstall script, additionally
 adding `--skip-autouninstaller` to skip an attempt to automatically
 remove system-installed software. Only the packaging files are removed
 and not things like software installed to Programs and Features.

If a package is failing because it is a dependency of another package
 or packages, then you may first need to consider if it needs to be
 removed as packages have dependencies for a reason. If
 you decide that you still want to remove it, head into
 `$env:ChocolateyInstall\lib` and find the package folder you want to
 be removed. Then delete the folder for the package. You should use
 this option only as a last resort.
